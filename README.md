# Early-Glaucoma-Detection-Using-EfficientNet-b1-on-Fundus-Images

Abstract—Early glaucoma screening is explored by processing low-quality fundus images using the EfficientNet-b1 model. The study employs anomaly detection techniques to identify glaucoma at an early stage, even in images with noise or artifacts, using a dataset of 4000 fundus images. To improve detection performance, the approach integrates image enhancement methods with EfficientNet-b1, enabling the system to adapt based on the quality of the images analyzed. The goal is to make glaucoma screening more reliable, particularly in resource constrained settings where imaging devices may produce lower quality outputs. By addressing issues related to image quality, the system can generalize across varying conditions, ensuring robust performance in real-world applications. This work highlights the importance of early diagnosis and the potential of using deep learning to improve outcomes, ultimately contributing to the advancement of glaucoma detection and reducing the risk of
vision loss.

Data Description

the dataset used is the glaucoma dataset, which is a balanced subset of standardized fundus images from the Rotterdam EyePACS AIROGS [1] set. The dataset is split
into three main subsets: training (4000 images, approximately 84%), validation (385 images, approximately 8%), and test (385 images, approximately 8%). The training set contains two distinct classes: referable glaucoma (RG) and non-referable glaucoma (NRG), with separate folders for each class. The data collection phase involves obtaining these images, which are then preprocessed to ensure uniformity and suitability for model training. First, the images are resized to a consistent dimension (either 128x128 or 300x300 pixels),ensuring they meet the input requirements of the model. To improve training stability and model performance, the images are normalized, scaling pixel values to a range between 0 and 1. Furthermore, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied to increase the diversity of the training data. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the model’s ability to generalize. This preprocessing pipeline ensures that the dataset is clean, standardized, and augmented, providing the model with high-quality, varied input for effective learning.

In conclusion, this research demonstrates the effective ap plication of an EfficientNet-B0 model enhanced by an autoen coder for accurate glaucoma detection from fundus images.The autoencoder efficiently learned to reconstruct images with minimal error, providing essential features for the EfficientNet classifier. With a training accuracy of 86.22% and a validation accuracy of 88.28%, along with low training and validation loss values, the EfficientNet-B0 model exhibited strong generalization and reliability in distinguishing between referable glaucoma (RG) and non-referable glaucoma (NRG) cases. The confusion matrix further highlighted the model’s classification accuracy, suggesting minimal overfitting and robust feature learning. The results indicate that this model can be a valuable tool in clinical settings for early glaucoma detection, contributing to timely diagnosis and intervention. Further improvements, including precision, recall, and F1
score analysis, and adjustments to hyperparameters or data augmentation techniques, could enhance the model’s robustness and reliability, paving the way for real-world deployment in automated glaucoma screening systems.
